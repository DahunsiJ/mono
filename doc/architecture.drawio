# Secure DevSecOps Architecture - Mono CI/CD Deployment

## **Overview**
This document provides an in-depth explanation of the **Secure DevSecOps Architecture** for the Mono CI/CD pipeline deployment. The architecture enforces security best practices at every stage of development, from **code scanning** to **secure Kubernetes deployment using Minikube**.

## **Architectural Diagram**
The following diagram illustrates the CI/CD pipeline and the security layers integrated into the workflow:

## **Key Components**
### **1. CI/CD Workflow - GitHub Actions**
- **Developer commits code** → GitHub Actions triggers the pipeline.
- **Security Scans run before deployment:**
  - ✅ **CodeQL** - Detects vulnerabilities in source code.
  - ✅ **Conftest** - Ensures Kubernetes manifests adhere to security policies.
  - ✅ **Trivy** - Scans container images for vulnerabilities.

### **2. Docker Image Build & Push**
- **Secure Docker Build:**
  - Uses a **distroless base image** to reduce attack surface.
  - Runs container as a **non-root user**.
- **Docker Hub Repository:**
  - Stores the container image before Kubernetes deployment.

### **3. Kubernetes Deployment (Minikube)**
- **Minikube** is used to simulate a cloud-native Kubernetes environment.
- The deployment follows security-first principles:
  - 🔐 **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** Enforces least privilege access.
  - 🌐 **Network Policies:** Restricts inter-pod communication.
  - 🛑 **Pod Security Policies:** Prevents privilege escalation and root access.
  - 📊 **Kube-bench:** Ensures Kubernetes security compliance.

## **Security Best Practices Implemented**
- **RBAC Policies** - Limits permissions to necessary users/services.
- **Pod Security Context** - Enforces non-root execution.
- **Image Scanning (Trivy)** - Prevents deployment of vulnerable containers.
- **GitHub Secrets Management** - Protects sensitive credentials.
- **Minimized Attack Surface** - Uses a lightweight, secured base image.

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Integrate GitOps** using ArgoCD for secure deployments.
- **Continuous Threat Monitoring** with Falco for runtime security.
- **Advanced Policy Enforcement** with Open Policy Agent (OPA).

## **Conclusion**
This architecture ensures a **secure, automated, and scalable DevSecOps pipeline** for deploying applications with **Kubernetes on Minikube**. By integrating security at every phase, this design prevents vulnerabilities from reaching production and enforces best DevSecOps practices.
